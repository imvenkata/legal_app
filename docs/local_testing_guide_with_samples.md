## Sample Documents

For testing purposes, we've prepared sample documents for each service. Create a `samples` directory in the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p samples/documents samples/research samples/contracts
```

### Document Analysis Samples
Download these sample legal documents to the `samples/documents` directory:

1. **Employment Contract**
   ```bash
   curl -o samples/documents/employment_contract.pdf https://example.com/samples/employment_contract.pdf
   ```
   
   Alternatively, create a simple employment contract using the text below and save it as `employment_contract.txt`:
   
   ```

### Legal Research Samples
Create sample case briefs in the `samples/research` directory:

1. **Contract Breach Case**
   Create a file named `contract_breach_case.txt` with the following content:
   
   ```
   CASE BRIEF: Smith v. Jones (2023)
   
   FACTS:
   On January 10, 2023, Smith entered into a contract with Jones for the delivery of 1,000 custom widgets by March 15, 2023, for a total price of $50,000. Smith paid a 50% deposit ($25,000) upon signing the contract. The contract specified that time was of the essence and included a clause stating that any delay in delivery would result in liquidated damages of $500 per day. Jones delivered the widgets on April 10, 2023, 26 days late. Smith refused to pay the remaining $25,000 and demanded a refund of $13,000 (26 days ร $500) from the initial deposit. Jones argued that the delay was caused by supply chain issues beyond his control and refused to pay the liquidated damages.
   
   LEGAL ISSUES:
   1. Is Jones liable for breach of contract?
   2. Are the liquidated damages enforceable?
   3. Does Jones have a valid defense based on supply chain issues?
   
   RELEVANT LAW:
   - Uniform Commercial Code ยง 2-615 (Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions)
   - Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 356 (Liquidated Damages and Penalties)
   - Local precedent: Wilson Corp v. Allen Inc (2022) - Court found that supply chain issues during post-pandemic period could constitute force majeure if properly documented
   
   ARGUMENTS:
   Smith argues that the contract terms were clear, time was of the essence, and the liquidated damages are reasonable given the nature of the custom widgets and their importance to Smith's business operations. Jones argues that the supply chain issues were unforeseeable and beyond his control, constituting a force majeure event that should excuse the delay in performance.
   ```

2. **Employment Law Case**
   Create a file named `employment_law_case.txt` with the following content:
   
   ```
   CASE BRIEF: Johnson v. Tech Innovations LLC (2024)
   
   FACTS:
   Sarah Johnson was employed by Tech Innovations LLC as a senior software engineer from May 2020 to December 2023. Her employment contract included a non-compete clause prohibiting her from working for any competing company within a 100-mile radius for 2 years after termination. In January 2024, Johnson accepted a position with DataSoft Inc., a direct competitor located 30 miles away. Tech Innovations filed for an injunction to enforce the non-compete agreement. Johnson argues that the non-compete is overly broad and unenforceable, and that her specialized skills in AI development mean that enforcing the agreement would cause her undue hardship.
   
   LEGAL ISSUES:
   1. Is the non-compete agreement enforceable?
   2. Does the agreement impose undue hardship on Johnson?
   3. Does Tech Innovations have a legitimate business interest to protect?
   
   RELEVANT LAW:
   - State statute on non-compete agreements (varies by jurisdiction)
   - Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 188 (Restraint of Trade)
   - Local precedent: Parker LLC v. Thompson (2021) - Court held that a 2-year, 50-mile radius non-compete for a software developer was reasonable
   
   ARGUMENTS:
   Tech Innovations argues that the non-compete is reasonable in scope and necessary to protect their proprietary AI algorithms and client relationships. Johnson argues that the 100-mile radius is excessive given the nature of remote work in the software industry, and that her specialized skills mean she cannot find comparable employment outside the restricted area without relocating her family.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem**: Backend service doesn't start
**Solution**: 
- Check if another process is using port 8000
- Verify that all dependencies are installed
- Check the console for error messages
```bash
# Check for processes using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Problem**: API endpoints return 500 errors
**Solution**:
- Check the backend logs for error details
- Verify that the database connection is working
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### Frontend Issues

**Problem**: Frontend doesn't connect to backend
**Solution**:
- Verify that the backend is running
- Check the API URL in the frontend configuration
- Look for CORS errors in the browser console

**Problem**: File upload doesn't work
**Solution**:
- Check file size limits
- Verify supported file formats
- Ensure the upload directory is writable

### LLM Integration Issues

**Problem**: LLM model doesn't generate results
**Solution**:
- Verify API keys are set correctly
- Check network connectivity to the LLM provider
- Ensure the selected model is available

## Next Steps

After successfully testing the application locally, you might want to:

1. **Customize the LLM Integration**
   - Add your own API keys for production use
   - Adjust model parameters for better results
   - Add support for additional LLM models

2. **Enhance the Sample Documents**
   - Add more diverse document types
   - Create industry-specific templates
   - Develop benchmark documents for performance testing

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Follow the Azure deployment guide
   - Set up proper authentication
   - Configure production databases

4. **Gather Feedback**
   - Document user experiences with different models
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Prioritize feature enhancements

By following this guide, you should be able to thoroughly test and demonstrate all three services of the Legal AI application using sample documents. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the application's capabilities and performance with different types of legal documents and LLM models.

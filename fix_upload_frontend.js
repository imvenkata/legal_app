// Fix Upload Frontend Guide
// This is a script to help fix document upload issues

/*
Instructions:

1. Make sure the backend is running on port 8000
   cd backend && source ../venv/bin/activate && python app.py

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   cd frontend && npm start

3. When the app is running, go to the browser and access the uploader at:
   http://localhost:3000/upload

4. Use these troubleshooting tips if you encounter issues:

   a. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
   
   b. Make sure the request is properly formatted in the Network tab
   
   c. Use a smaller file for testing (< 2MB)
   
   d. If you get CORS errors, make sure the backend CORS settings are correct:
      - Check that frontend URL (localhost:3000) is in the allowed origins
      - Check that all required headers are allowed
   
   e. If authentication issues occur, you might need to log in first
      - Go to /login and sign in
      - Then try uploading again
   
   f. Try using our simplified uploader component:
      - Navigate to SimpleDocumentUploader component at /upload
      - This bypasses complex state management and uses direct API calls

5. If all else fails, use curl to test the API directly:
   curl -v -F "file=@test_document.txt" -F "title=Test Document" -F "description=Testing upload" http://localhost:8000/api/documents/upload

// Make sure these services files are created:
// frontend/src/services/documents.js  
// frontend/src/components/document/DocumentUploader.jsx (renamed to SimpleDocumentUploader)

console.log("Run this guide in your terminal to fix document upload issues.");
